                                Megan and I met during summer school after our freshman year at UCLA—we hit it off and wound up rooming together during junior and senior year. After graduation, we packed up our apartment for San Francisco—we had both gotten our first (grown-up!) jobs in the city and found an apartment together in the Inner Richmond. Our Monday night tradition was pretty much my most favorite thing, ever: pizza from Giorgio’s and the newest episode of The Bachelor.
